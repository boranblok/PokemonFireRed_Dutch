# PokemonFireRed_Dutch
Translation project to translate Pok√©mon FireRed (GBA) to Dutch


This project contains several items:

**Pokemon Fire Red (U)[!][Dut].bps**  
The main patch file, use [Flips](https://github.com/Alcaro/Flips) or other bps patcher to apply to the original dump.

The original rom should have these checksum values:

    CRC-32: dd88761c
       MD4: a41b7c4de59b703c81c7256599c991c7
       MD5: e26ee0d44e809351c8ce2d73c7400cdd
     SHA-1: 41cb23d8dccc8ebd7c649cd8fbb58eeace6e2fdc

**BPRE.ini**  
The [Advance-Text](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/427/) ini file used for the *translated* ROM. You can use this with Advance-Text to make modifications yourself to fix Typo's or so. I would however like it if you also supplied these, so I can integrate them.

**Extended BPRE.ini**  
The Advance-Text ini file with all the pointers to text that needs translation in the *original* ROM. This is only useful if you want to make a translation yourself in a different language. But I have to look up all new text references anyways, so I might as well share the text locations I find.
