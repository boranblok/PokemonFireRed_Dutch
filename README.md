# PokemonFireRed_Dutch
Translation project to translate Pok√©mon FireRed (GBA) to Dutch


This project contains two main items:

**Pokemon Fire Red (U)[!][Dut].bps**  
The main patch file, use [Flips](https://github.com/Alcaro/Flips) or other bps patcher to apply to the original dump.

The original rom should have these checksum values:

    CRC-32: dd88761c
       MD4: a41b7c4de59b703c81c7256599c991c7
       MD5: e26ee0d44e809351c8ce2d73c7400cdd
     SHA-1: 41cb23d8dccc8ebd7c649cd8fbb58eeace6e2fdc

**Pokemon_FireRed_Dutch.txt**  
The translation file used to apply translations to the rom. This is using my own tools **TODO LINK to working release**

This tool used to use Advance-Text, but this proved unworkable for the large amount of work.
